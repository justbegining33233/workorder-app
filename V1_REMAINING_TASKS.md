## 1. Real-time Updates (WebSockets)

**Priority:** High | **Status:** ✅ 95% Complete

- [x] Install and configure Socket.io server (v4.8.3, JWT auth, CORS)
- [x] Create WebSocket connection handler (room-based: user, role, shop)
- [x] Implement live chat functionality
  - [x] Customer ↔ Shop messaging (works via REST + polling)
  - [x] **Real-time message delivery via Socket.IO push** — ✅ FIXED: `socket.ts` now uses Socket.IO client with polling fallback
  - [x] Typing indicators (`typing-start`/`typing-stop` events in server.js)
  - [x] Message read receipts (DB fields `isRead`/`readAt` + PUT endpoint)
  - [ ] **Read receipt notification via Socket.IO push** — socket events forward to window, needs server emit
- [x] Implement live status updates via Socket.IO push
  - [x] Work order status broadcast handler exists in server.js
  - [x] **Dashboard uses Socket.IO push** — ✅ FIXED: `RealTimeWorkOrders.tsx` + `MessagingCard.tsx` use socket events with 30s polling fallback
  - [ ] **Notifications** — TopNavBar still polls (could be improved)
- [x] Tech location tracking
  - [x] GPS coordinate sharing (Capacitor Geolocation + navigator fallback)
  - [x] Live map updates (`TechLiveMap.tsx` with Leaflet + Socket.IO)
  - [x] Location history (last 100 GPS points, speed/heading)
- [x] Reconnection logic (exponential backoff, max 5 attempts)
- [x] Error handling (socket error events + disconnect handlers)

**Remaining work:** TopNavBar notification polling could be further optimized. Read receipt push needs server-side emit.

**Key files:**
- `src/lib/socket.ts` — polling logic that needs Socket.IO migration
- `src/components/MessagingCard.tsx` — 5s polling interval
- `src/components/RealTimeWorkOrders.tsx` — polling-based updates
- `src/components/TopNavBar.tsx` — notification polling

---

## 2. Service Pricing & Management

**Priority:** High | **Status:** ✅ 95% Complete

- [x] Create `/api/services` endpoints
  - [x] GET - List all services with category filtering (7 categories)
  - [x] POST - Create new service (Zod validated)
  - [x] PUT - Update service (name, category, price, duration, description)
  - [x] DELETE - Remove service (with ownership validation)
- [x] Create service management UI page (`src/app/shop/services/page.tsx`)
  - [x] Catalog tab (148 services across 7 categories)
  - [x] Custom tab for shop-specific services
  - [x] My Services tab with filtering
  - [x] Add/Edit service modal
  - [x] Category filtering (diesel, gas, small-engine, heavy-equipment, resurfacing, welding, tire)
  - [x] Price and duration inputs
- [ ] Integrate with work order creation
  - [x] Service search exists in work order form
  - [ ] **Auto-populate pricing from selected service** — not wired
  - [ ] **Calculate labor time from service duration** — not wired
- [x] Default services seeder (148 services — exceeds original 51 target)
- [x] Validation (Zod schemas + rate limiting + ownership checks)

- [x] **✅ FIXED: Estimate data now persisted to database**
  - [x] `workOrderUpdateSchema` updated to include `estimate` object (line items, subtotal, tax, notes)
  - [x] PUT handler now saves `estimate` JSON to WorkOrder model
  - [x] `estimate Json?` field already existed on WorkOrder model — no migration needed

## ✅ Critical Issues (RESOLVED)

## 🟡 Remaining Items

3. Service pricing auto-fill in work order form — endpoint exists, UI wiring needed
4. Work order ↔ inventory parts selector UI + auto-deduct
5. Customer saved addresses — no model, API, or UI
6. Customer dashboard widgets — UI underbuilt
7. Analytics export buttons on dashboard pages — endpoint exists, UI buttons needed
8. Email template management UI
